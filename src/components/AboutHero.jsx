          <h1> Welcome to My Journey</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Alvis Loh—a Certified Life Coach and Senior Military
            Intelligence Expert (SMIE) serving as an ME-4 Intelligence Officer
            in Singapore’s Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS).
            <br />
            <br />
            My career spans military intelligence, cybersecurity, data
            analytics, and leadership—fields that demand precision,
            adaptability, and resilience. As an officer, I navigate complex
            intelligence operations, leveraging my expertise in geopolitics,
            crisis management, and technology to safeguard national security.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond the military, I am deeply passionate about personal
            development and coaching. Having graduated with a Diploma in
            Business Management (Merit) from Nanyang Polytechnic, I have honed
            my skills in strategic planning, leadership, and innovation.
            <br />
            <br />I believe in empowering individuals to overcome challenges,
            unlock their potential, and create meaningful impact in their lives.
            Whether in the field of intelligence or personal growth, my mission
            remains the same—to lead, inspire, and drive transformation. Let’s
            connect and explore how we can grow together!
